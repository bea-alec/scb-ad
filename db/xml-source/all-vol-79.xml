        <Description>Real GDP increased 3.7 percent in the third quarter of 1998, according to the &quot;final&quot; NIPA estimate; the &quot;preliminary&quot; estimate issued last month had shown a 3.9-percent increase. A downward revision to net exports more than offset an upward revision to business fixed investment. Corporate profits increased $6.4 billion (0.8 percent at a quarterly rate) in the third quarter, as an increase in profits of domestic nonfinancial corporations more than offset a decrease in profits from the rest of the world.</Description>

        <Description>The U.S. current-account deficit increased $4.6 billion, to $61.3 billion, in the third quarter of 1998. The increase was accounted for by an increase in the deficit on investment income, a decrease in the surplus on services, and an increase in net unilateral transfers. In the capital account, capital outflows decreased more than capital inflows. U.S. assets abroad increased $48.1 billion after increasing $109.8 billion, and foreign assets in the United States increased $112.9 billion after increasing $164.9 billion.</Description>

        <Description>The &quot;preliminary&quot; estimate of real GDP shows a 6.1-percent increase in the fourth quarter of 1998 after an increase of 3.7 percent in the third quarter. The 6.1-percent increase is 0.5 percentage point higher than the &quot;advance&quot; estimate published last month; the upward revision reflects a downward revision to imports of goods, which are subtracted in the calculation of GDP, and upward revisions to personal consumption expenditures for nondurable goods and to exports of goods. The price index for gross domestic purchases increased 0.8 percent in the fourth quarter after increasing 0.7 percent in the third.</Description>

        <Author>Kurt S. Bersani, Laura M. Bilenki</Author>
        <Description>Each year, BEA prepares a &quot;translation&quot; of the administration's budget that puts the budget's receipts and outlays on a basis that is consistent with the framework of the NIPA's. For fiscal year 2000, the Federal current surplus on the NIPA basis would be $119.1 billion, compared with the administration's budget surplus of $117.3 billion. The NIPA estimate of receipts would exceed the budget estimate of receipts by $104.0 billion, and the NIPA estimate of current expenditures would exceed the budget estimate of outlays by $102.2 billion.</Description>

        <Description>The current surplus of State and local governments increased $16.1 billion, to $150.2 billion, in 1998. As in recent years, the increase in receipts exceeded the increase in current expenditures. For 1999, available information suggests that receipts will decelerate and that current expenditures will accelerate, so that the current surplus is expected to change little.</Description>

        <Author>Christopher L. Bach</Author>
        <Description>In the fourth quarter of 1998, the U.S. current-account deficit decreased to $63.8 billion from $65.7 billion in the third quarter; the decrease was attributable to decreases in the deficits on goods and on investment income and an increase in the surplus on services. In the capital account, foreign assets in the United States increased $183.1 billion after increasing $98.7 billion, and U.S. assets abroad increased $88.8 billion after increasing $60.4 billion. For the year 1998, the U.S. current-account deficit increased to $233.4 billion from $155.2 billion in 1997; the increase was largely attributable to an increase in the deficit on goods, but an increase in the deficit on investment income and a decrease in the surplus on services also contributed. In the capital account, foreign assets in the United States increased $542.5 billion after increasing $733.4 billion, and U.S. assets abroad increased $305.4 billion after increasing $478.5 billion.</Description>

        <Author>Dale P. Shannon, William J. Zeile, Kenneth P. Johnson</Author>
        <Description>An analysis of the employment of foreign-owned U.S. manufacturing establishments by BEA economic area indicates that the regional distribution of newly built, or &quot;greenfield,&quot; establishments is relatively concentrated in parts of New England and the Southeast. By country of ownership, the regional patterns for Canadian- and Japanese-owned greenfield establishments differ noticeably from those of other foreign-owned greenfield establishments. These findings are based on a new data set on foreign-owned U.S. manufacturing establishments that BEA prepared from microdata files that were made available by arrangement with the Census Bureau's Center for Economic Studies.</Description>

        <Description>Outlays by foreign investors to acquire or establish businesses in the United States jumped to a record $201.0 billion in 1998 from $69.7 billion in 1997. The 1998 total was boosted by two exceptionally large acquisitions, but even excluding them, outlays were still considerably higher than the previous record.</Description>

        <Title>U.S. International Transactions, Revised Estimates for 1982--98</Title>
        <Author>Christopher L. Bach</Author>
        <Description>In this year's annual revision of the balance of payments accounts, the structure of the accounts is modified in order to improve the presentation of the different types of international transactions and to bring the accounts into closer alignment with international guidelines. As a result, U.S. international transactions are now classified into three groups---the current account, the capital account, and the financial account. Several major improvements to the estimates are also introduced, including improved measures of income receipts and improved seasonal adjustment of exports of goods. The revised estimate of the U.S. current-account deficit for 1998 is $-220.6 billion, compared with the previously published estimate of $-233.4 billion.</Description>

        <Description>The net international investment position of the United States became more negative in 1998: On a current-cost basis, it was $-1,239.2 billion, compared with $-968.2 billion in 1997; and on a market-value basis, it was $-1,537.5 billion, compared with $-1,066.3 billion in 1997. The net position on both bases became more negative mainly as a result of large net financial inflows and strong price appreciation in foreign-owned assets in the United States that reflected a steep rise in U.S. stock prices.</Description>

        <Description>In 1998, the U.S. direct investment position abroad valued at historical cost increased 13 percent, reflecting record capital outflows---mainly equity capital and reinvested earnings. By country, the largest increases were with the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. The foreign direct investment position in the United States valued at historical cost increased 17 percent, reflecting record capital inflows that were boosted by two exceptionally large transactions involving acquisitions of U.S. firms. By country, the largest increases were with Germany and the United Kingdom.</Description>

        <Description>The U.S. current-account deficit increased $6.9 billion, to $68.6 billion, in the first quarter of 1999, as a large increase in the deficit on goods more than offset a small increase in the surplus on services, a small decrease in the deficit on income, and a decrease in net unilateral current transfers. In the financial account, net recorded inflows slowed to $84.1 billion from $99.2 billion, as a sharp slowdown in inflows for foreign-owned assets in the United States more than offset a shift from outflows to inflows for transactions in U.S.-owned assets abroad.</Description>

        <Author>Brent R. Moulton, Robert P. Parker, Eugene P. Seskin</Author>
        <Description>The upcoming comprehensive revision of the NIPA's will feature a number of definitional and classificational changes that will significantly improve the NIPA measures of output, investment, and saving. In particular, business and government expenditures for software will be recognized as fixed investment, government employee retirement plans will be reclassified from the government sector to the personal sector, and certain transactions will be reclassified as capital transfers. The recognition of software as investment will raise GDP (for 1996, by roughly 1 percent); the other definitional and classificational changes will have little effect on GDP, but several of them will raise private saving and reduce government saving.</Description>

        <Title>Foreign Direct Investment in the United States: Preliminary Results From the 1997 Benchmark Survey</Title>
        <Author>William J. Zeile</Author>
        <Description>In 1997, U.S. affiliates of foreign companies accounted for 6.3 percent of U.S. gross product originating in private nonbank industries and for 4.9 percent of U.S. employment. Trade by U.S. affiliates accounted for 20 percent of U.S. exports of goods and for 30 percent of U.S. imports of goods. Affiliates accounted for more than half of U.S. exports of goods to Japan and for more than half of U.S. imports from Japan, Switzerland, Germany, and Sweden. These findings are based on the preliminary results of BEA's 1997 Benchmark Survey of Foreign Investment in the United States. This survey marks the first use by BEA of a new industry classification system that is based on the North American Industry Classification System.</Description>

        <Description>Real GDP increased 2.3 percent in the second quarter of 1999 after increasing 4.3 percent in the first quarter; the slowdown was mainly accounted for by a deceleration in consumer spending and a downturn in government spending. The price index for gross domestic purchases increased 2.1 percent after increasing 1.2 percent; the step-up reflected a sharp upturn in energy prices.</Description>

Seventeen new tables will be introduced, including tables that provide additional detail and supplement the existing table on contributions to percent change in real GDP, tables on changes in the net stock of produced assets and on motor vehicle output, and summary tables that highlight percent changes and contributions to percent changes in real GDP. In addition, many of the existing tables will be redesigned to reflect the definitional changes, such as the recognition of business and government expenditures on software as investment.</Description>

        <Title>A Preview of the 1999 Comprehensive Revision of the National Income and Product Accounts: Statistical Changes</Title>
        <Author>Brent R. Moulton, Eugene P. Seskin</Author>
        <Description>The upcoming comprehensive revision of the NIPA's will feature a number of statistical changes that improve the estimates by using newly available source data or by introducing new methodologies. The major source data that will be incorporated include the 1992 benchmark input-output accounts, preliminary estimates from the 1996 annual update of these accounts, selected data from the 1997 economic censuses, and regular source data that would normally be incorporated in an annual revision of the NIPA's. In addition, methodological changes will be incorporated that make the income estimates more consistent with the product estimates, improve the estimates of State and local government taxes, provide a better measure of the real value of unpriced bank services, and improve the prices of a number of NIPA estimates.</Description>

        <Author>Douglas B. Weinberg</Author>
        <Description>The U.S. current-account deficit increased $12.0 billion, to $80.7 billion, in the second quarter of 1999; most of the increase was accounted for by a large increase in the deficit on goods. In the financial account, net recorded inflows surged $43.2 billion, to $116.9 billion; partly reflecting several very large acquisitions of U.S. companies by foreign companies, inflows for foreign-owned assets in the United States increased even more strongly than outflows for U.S.-owned assets abroad.</Description>

        <Author>Michael A. Mann, Laura L. Brokenbaugh, Sylvia E. Bargas</Author>
        <Description>In 1998, U.S. cross-border exports of private services increased 2 percent to $245.7 billion, and U.S. cross-border imports of private services increased 8 percent to $165.3 billion; as a result, the U.S. surplus on cross-border trade in services decreased to $80.4 billion from $88.0 billion. In 1997, sales of services abroad by foreign affiliates of U.S. companies again substantially exceeded sales of services in the United States by U.S. affiliates of foreign companies: Sales by foreign affiliates were $258.3 billion, up 16 percent from 1996, while sales by U.S. affiliates were $205.5 billion, up 22 percent. About half of the increase in sales by U.S. affiliates was attributable to the use of new definitions of sales of services that are based on the North American Industry Classification System.</Description>

        <Author></Author>
        <Description>On October 28, 1999, BEA released revised estimates for 1959--99 from the 11th comprehensive revision of the national income and product accounts. Comprehensive revisions, which are carried out every 4 to 5 years, are an important part of BEA's regular process for improving and modernizing its accounts to keep pace with the ever-changing U.S. economy. According to the revised estimates, real GDP is growing faster than previously estimated, and the rate of personal saving is higher, though still with a pronounced downtrend.</Description>

        <Author>J. Steven Landefeld</Author>
        <Description>Recently, the Panel on Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting, a panel of experts under the aegis of the National Research Council's Committee on National Statistics, issued a Congressionally requested assessment of the work on environmental accounting that BEA published in April 1994. The panel concluded that BEA had produced a set of sound and objective prototype satellite accounts and that such environmental accounts, within the context of a broader set of nonmarket accounts, would add valuable information to the basic NIPA's.</Description>

        <Author>Anthony DiLullo, Hugh Henderson</Author>
        <Description>For 1997, after the reconciliation, the U.S. current-account balance with Canada shows a U.S. deficit, in contrast to the U.S. surplus that is shown in the U.S.-published accounts. For 1998, the reconciled balance shows a larger U.S. deficit than is shown in the U.S.-published accounts. These annual reconciliations show how the current-account estimates would appear if both countries used the same definitions, methodologies, and data sources.</Description>

        <Title>Improved Estimates of the National Income and Product Accounts for 1959--98: Results of the Comprehensive Revision</Title>
        <Author>Eugene P. Seskin</Author>
        <Description>On October 28, 1999, BEA released revised NIPA estimates beginning with 1959 that reflected the incorporation of major definitional and statistical improvements that are designed to better measure the evolving U.S. economy. This article describes the revisions to GDP and to other major NIPA aggregates and components, and it identifies the principal sources of these revisions. For example, according to the revised estimates, real GDP grew faster than previously estimated; the faster growth rate was primarily attributable to a definitional change that recognized software as investment and to statistical changes to the price estimates.</Description>

The price index for gross domestic purchases increased 1.7 percent, 0.1 percentage point more than the previously published increase. Corporate profits increased $8.2 billion (or 0.9 percent at a quarterly rate) in the third quarter. The Federal Government current surplus increased $16.6 billion, to $134.7 billion, in the third quarter, and the State and local government surplus increased $10.7 billion, to $48.3 billion.</Description>
