Grimm','A recent study by BEA found that the quarterly estimates of real GDP are reliable indicators of whether the economy is expanding or contracting, whether the economy is accelerating or decelerating, and whether the economy is growing at rates above, near, or below the long-term trend. The estimates were also found to be good indicators of cyclical peaks and troughs. In addition, the study found that the revisions by quarter differ substantially (for example, the average revision to the third-quarter estimates differs noticeably from that to the fourth-quarter estimates) and that the revisions due to seasonal factors tend to at least partly offset the revisions due to other causes.','http://bea.gov/scb/pdf/2002/01January/0102ReliableNIPAs.pdf','National, National income and product accounts (NIPAs)','2002-01-15',NULL,'Tables','http://bea.gov/scb/pdf/2002/01january/0102rely.xls',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),('SCB-82-01-02',82,1,'January',2002,'Business Situation: Final Estimates for the Third Quarter of 2001','Daniel Larkins, Frederick von Batchelder','Real GDP declined 1.3 percent in the third quarter of 2001, according to the \"final\" NIPA estimate, after four quarters of subpar growth.

This article describes the revisions to GDP and to other major NIPA aggregates and components, and it identifies the principal sources of these revisions. For example, according to the revised estimates, real GDP grew faster than previously estimated; the faster growth rate was primarily attributable to a definitional change that recognized software as investment and to statistical changes to the price estimates.','http://bea.gov/scb/pdf/NATIONAL/NIPA/1999/1299niw.pdf','National, National income and product accounts (NIPAs)','1999-12-15',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),('SCB-79-12-02',79,12,'December',1999,'Business Situation','Larry R.
